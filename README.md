Graph Algorithms in Java (DSA)
This repository contains implementations of fundamental and advanced graph algorithms using Java. It serves as a resource for learning, practicing, and understanding graph data structures and their applications in solving real-world problems.

Features
Graph Representation: Adjacency list, adjacency matrix, and edge list.
Traversal Algorithms:
   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   Depth-First Search (DFS)
Shortest Path Algorithms:
   Dijkstra’s Algorithm
   Bellman-Ford Algorithm
   Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
    Prim’s Algorithm
    Kruskal’s Algorithm
Other Graph Problems:
   Detecting Cycles in Graphs (Directed/Undirected)
   Topological Sorting
   Strongly Connected Components (SCC) using Kosaraju’s Algorithm
   Bipartite Graph Checking
Custom Input Handling: User-friendly ways to input graph data.
 Applications
   Solve competitive programming problems.
   Learn and visualize graph theory concepts.
   Use as a reference for academic projects and interview preparation.
